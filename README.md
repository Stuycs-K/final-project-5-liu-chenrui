## Group Info

Name: Chenrui Liu the Botanical Battle Brain

## Project Description

This is a remake of Plants vs Zombies 1 but simplified with four plants and the default normal zombie type. The gameplay loop is endless waves of zombies that progressively increases in size every 10 seconds. You are not expected to survive. Manage cooldowns and your sun currency to make the best out of your run or simply run through all the features in about two minutes.

## Instructions

There are no libraries to install. Everything is ready from the start. There are no keybinds and you will be using your mouse only. No dragging or holding down your mouse button. All clicking.

To run through the features as fast as possible:
0. Click Start on the Starting Screen.
1. Collect random sun and plant a sunflower.
2. Place a walnut to stop the first zombie.
3. Save up for a peashooter to kill zombie.
4. Let a zombie reach the end to the lawnmower.
5. At this point you should have a nice bunch of zombies. You can blow up a 3x3 radius of zombies with cherry bomb.
6. Let a zombie reach the end for the game to stop.

## Potential Major Bugs

- After a plant has been eaten such as the peashooter, it's possible that it may continue to shoot peas as a ghost. Just try to plant the peashooters as close to the lawnmowers as possible.
